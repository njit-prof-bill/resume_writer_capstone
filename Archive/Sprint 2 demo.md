Hey All,

I hope everyone is enjoying their spring break. And yeah, your break is nearly over and it's time to think about class again. This Tuesday we will be completing sprint 1 and kicking off sprint 2. Sprint 1 ends with each team giving a demo of their work. You don't need to write a PowerPoint, but you do have to show off your app. Here's the script each team will follow:

#### Getting Started

- We will be running the demo as a "blackbox", i.e. showing capabilities via the UX
- Make sure that everyone on the team's device is capable of running the demo
- Describe and new technologies you have added to your application and describe how are managing user's career history.

#### Frontend Demonstration (Core Functionality)

**1. Basic Application Layout**
- Login a user onto your app to display these requirements:
  - Banner with application name
  - User's name clearly displayed
  - Functional logout button/link
  - Navigation system (dropdown or side panel)

**Stretch items:**
- Custom-designed logo
- User avatar displayed
- Show/hide functionality for navigation panel
- Settings/preferences page
- Collection of name/contact information
- Theme toggle (light/dark), respecting system preference

**2. Resume Upload Interface**
- Upload a Word resume in .docx format via the frontend interface.
- Show upload progress indicator and confirm successful parsing/storage via frontend notification.

**Stretch item:**
- Upload and demonstrate successful parsing of a .pdf file.

**3. Free-form Career History Submission and Display**
- Manually enter career details via frontend submission form. **NOTE!** have this text ready in Notepad or a text editor to copy and paste into the form.
- Display the submitted details in a formatted, scrollable timeline clearly showing:
  - Job titles
  - Company names
  - Employment dates
  - Key responsibilities

**Stretch items:**
- Editable career history form, demonstrate updating and confirm successful changes through frontend notifications.
- Display accomplishments associated with career entries.

**4. Education Information Display**
- Display user's stored education details clearly on the frontend:
  - Degrees earned
  - Institutions
  - Attendance dates
  - GPA

**Stretch items:**
- Editable education information form with add/remove functionality.
- Confirm updates through frontend notifications and immediate feedback.

I will be randomly selecting the order of the demos. Oh yeah ... and don't forget to write up and submit your retrospective report.

See you Tuesday,
Prof Bill
