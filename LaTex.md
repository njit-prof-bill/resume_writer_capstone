### LaTex

Here are some resources and ideas to help your students get started:
1. **Docker Images for LaTeX**: There are pre-built Docker images available, such as `blang/latex` or `tianon/latex`, which include LaTeX distributions. These can save time and effort in setting up the environment.
2. **API Frameworks**: Students can use frameworks like Flask (Python) or Express (Node.js) to create the API. The API can make system calls to the LaTeX compiler inside the container.
3. **Security Considerations**: Since LaTeX can execute arbitrary code, it's important to sandbox the environment and validate input files to prevent malicious activities.
4. **Deployment**: For hosting, platforms like AWS, Google Cloud, or Azure can run Docker containers. Alternatively, services like Heroku or Render also support Docker-based deployments.
