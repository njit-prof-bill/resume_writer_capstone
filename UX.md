### **Initial Prototype UX Requirements**

The initial user experience will consist of a **Landing Page**, **Authentication Flow**, and a **Home Page** with basic navigation. This prototype will provide a functional foundation for user authentication and future feature development.

---

### **1. Landing Page**
#### **Use Case: Display Landing Page with Authentication Options**
- **Actors:** Job Seeker (Visitor)
- **Preconditions:**
  - The user is not authenticated.
  - The frontend is configured to route unauthenticated users to the landing page.

- **Flow of Events:**
  1. The user visits the application's root URL (`/`).
  2. The system displays a landing page that describes the application's purpose and features.
  3. The landing page includes two primary actions:
     - A "Sign In" button that directs users to the login page.
     - A "Register" button that directs users to the sign-up page.
  4. If the user is already authenticated, they are automatically redirected to the **Home Page** instead.

- **Error Handling:**
  - If the landing page fails to load due to a network issue, an appropriate error message is displayed.

- **Acceptance Criteria:**
  - The landing page is accessible to unauthenticated users.
  - The landing page provides a clear and concise service description.
  - Users can navigate to either the sign-in or registration page.
  - Authenticated users are redirected to the home page instead of seeing the landing page.

### **2. Authentication Flow**
#### **Use Case: User Authentication via Login or Registration**
- **Actors:** Job Seeker (End User), Authentication Service
- **Preconditions:**
  - The authentication provider is correctly configured.

- **Flow of Events:**
  1. The user clicks "Sign In" or "Register" on the **Landing Page**.
  2. The system navigates the user to the respective authentication page.
  3. The user enters valid credentials and submits the form.
  4. The authentication provider verifies the credentials and returns an authentication token.
  5. The system stores the authentication token securely.
  6. The user is redirected to the **Home Page**.

- **Error Handling:**
  - If authentication fails (e.g., incorrect password), an appropriate error message is displayed.
  - If authentication succeeds but the token storage fails, the system prevents access and logs the error.

- **Acceptance Criteria:**
  - Users can successfully log in or register using the authentication provider.
  - The system securely stores the authentication token.
  - Upon successful authentication, users are redirected to the home page.
  - Invalid credentials produce a user-friendly error message.

### **3. Home Page**
#### **Use Case: Display Minimal Home Page After Authentication**
- **Actors:** Job Seeker (Authenticated User)
- **Preconditions:**
  - The user is authenticated and has a valid session.

- **Flow of Events:**
  1. Upon successful login, the system navigates the user to the home page (`/home`).
  2. The home page displays a placeholder message, such as "Welcome" or "Hello World."
  3. The page includes a navigation element with a **"Log Out"** button.

- **Error Handling:**
  - If an unauthenticated user attempts to access the home page, they are redirected to the **Landing Page**.
  - If there is a session timeout, the system redirects the user to the login page.

- **Acceptance Criteria:**
  - Authenticated users are correctly routed to the home page.
  - The home page displays a placeholder message.
  - Unauthenticated users are redirected to the landing page.

---

### **4. Log Out Functionality**
#### **Use Case: Log Out and Redirect to Landing Page**
- **Actors:** Job Seeker (Authenticated User), Authentication Service
- **Preconditions:**
  - The user is authenticated and currently on the home page.

- **Flow of Events:**
  1. The user clicks the "Log Out" button.
  2. The system invalidates the authentication token and removes it from storage.
  3. The user is redirected to the **Landing Page**.

- **Error Handling:**
  - If token revocation fails, the system attempts to clear the stored session and logs the issue.
  - If a user manually deletes their token but doesn’t log out properly, the system detects the missing token and redirects them to the login page.

- **Acceptance Criteria:**
  - Users can log out from the home page.
  - The authentication token is properly invalidated upon logout.
  - After logout, users are redirected to the landing page.
